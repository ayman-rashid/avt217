	<p>Now, a team led by Richard Bevins, a geologist at Aberystwyth University in Wales, have presented new evidence that the Altar Stone does not match the Welsh deposits, throwing the conventional provenance of the stone into doubt. To that end, Bevins and his colleagues “question whether the Altar Stone should not be ‘lumped’ with the Welsh bluestones,” a finding that has inspired them to broaden their “search for the Altar Stone source into northern Britain,” according to a new study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.
“We started the study by examining rocks from the Old Red Sandstone outcrops that Thomas (in his seminal 1923 paper) had proposed for the possible source of the Altar Stone in west Wales,” Bevins told Motherboard in an email. “Thomas seemed to want all of the bluestones to come from a limited area, in and around the Mynydd Preseli.”
