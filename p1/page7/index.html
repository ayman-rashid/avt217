“The sites of interest are described in the paper, mainly northern England and Scotland but we need to develop our programme of fieldwork in those areas,” Bevins said. “We shall concentrate on those areas with known Neolithic activity as guided by our archaeological colleagues.”
Stonehenge is already considered an outlier among Neolithic structures because its bluestones were imported from Wales, whereas most other rock monuments from this period are built from local stones. Bevins and his colleagues note that “the bluestones in fact represent one of the longest transport distances known from source to monument construction site anywhere in the world” in the study.
