“This long-distance connection occurred during the Stage 2 construction phase (c. 2500 BCE) so maybe the Altar Stone arrived during this period, well after the bluestones were erected?” the team concluded in the study. “The timing of these links needs to be further explored in order to try to discover when the Altar Stone arrived at Stonehenge. These considerations will inform the next phase of our investigations.”
