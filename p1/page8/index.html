Now, the researchers have proposed that the Altar Stone may hail from an even more remote region than its companion bluestones, which could be several hundred miles to the north. If Bevins and his colleagues are able to pinpoint the likely source of the special monument, it could reveal new insights about the purpose of the Altar Stone, the timeline of Stonehenge’s construction, and the lives of the people who built the world-famous structure.
 “It could well have significant implications for the movement and interactions of people in Neolithic times but that is an area that our archaeology colleagues will have views on,” Bevins said. “There are known links between Neolithic people (or their ‘culture’) from the northern British Isles and Neolithic Wessex and Stonehenge.”
